# What's the Point?
Points are a representation of power, development, and skill for all [[TTRPGs#Characters|Characters]]. They are primarily spent on Aspects and Paths. The value of Aspects and Paths generally do not exceed 10.
# Experience
Each Point is made up of 10 Experience. Characters gain Experience by moving the [[TTRPGs#Story|Story]] forward, participating in large Events, from Training, or showing up to the session, being especially creative, or anything that [[TTRPGs#The Weaver|The Weaver]] sees as beneficial to the game and deserves rewarding.

Generally, at least 1 Experience should be awarded to each Character at the end of each session.
# Unspent Points
After a Full-Rest a Character may convert 10 Experience in to 1 Unspent Point. Unspent Points may then be spent on other parts of the Character.
# Spent Points
The number of Spent Points a Character has can be used to quickly determine how powerful a Character is. This can be used for balancing Events with other Characters or just as a quick representation of Character growth.
