Whenever a [[TTRPG#Characters|Character]] is about to take [[Damage]], they may Dodge.
Dodging is subtracting any chosen amount of remaining [[Stamina]] instead of [[Health]]. Any Damage left over after this reduction reduces Health as normal.

>[!Example]
>A Character has 10/10 Stamina and 12/12 Health.
>The Character is about to take 11 Damage.
>They choose to Dodge and reduces their Stamina by 6.
>They take the rest of the Damage and now have 4/10 Stamina and 6/12 Health.
