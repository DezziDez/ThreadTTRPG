Stamina is a resource that represents a [Character's](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters) Will and Endurance.

A Character's Maximum Stamina value is calculated by adding the [Points](./Point.md) of the Character's [Mind](./Aspect.md#♦%20Mind) and [Spirit](./Aspect.md#♠%20Spirit) [Aspects](./Aspect.md).
>[!Example]
>If a Character has 4 Points in Mind and 2 Points in Spirit. Then the Character has a maximum Stamina of 6. (4+2 = 6)
# Out of Steam
Whenever a Character has less than 0 Maximum Stamina, the Character gains 1 Stack of the [Unconscious](../States/Unconscious.md) [State](./State.md) for every negative Maximum Stamina the Character has.
