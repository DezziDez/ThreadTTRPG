**Verb** ~ To make or produce with care, skill, or ingenuity
# Whatcha Doin'?
To Craft is to create [Objects](./Object.md) from Materials using time and skill. All [Characters](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters) can Craft using [Checks](./Check.md) and a bit of elbow grease.
# Materials
All Objects that are Crafted require Materials. These materials have their own [Properties](./Object.md#Properties) that are added to the final Object.

To simulate the losses in the Crafting process, more Materials are needed than the finished Object will be made of. The amount of Materials needed is twice the final [Bulk](./Size.md#Bulk) of the Object. Which is also one additional [Size](./Size.md) category.

>[!Example]
>A Character wishes to Craft a bow, which will have a Bulk of 2.
>The Character needs 4 Bulk worth of Materials to Craft the bow.
# Time and Checks
To Craft an Object a Character must spend a considerable amount of time doing so. The amount of time an Object takes to Craft is proportional to the number of Properties the Object being created has.

A Craft Check must be performed for each Property of the Object, taking 4 hours of the Character's time per check. The difficulty of a Craft Check generally starts at 10 for the first property and increases by 5 for each additional property beyond the first.
## Failure
If a Character fails a Craft Check then that Character must perform the check again. If a Character fails any Craft Check three times during the Craft process, then the Object is ruined and the materials are lost.

>[!Example]
>A Character wishes to Craft a bow, which has three properties.
>The Character will need to succeed a Craft Check for each property.
>The first Check would be a difficulty of 10.
>The second Check would be a difficulty of 15.
>The third Check would be a difficulty of 20.
>If the Character succeeds all three checks in a row, the amount of time is took to make the bow would be 12 hours.

>[!Note]
>Craft Checks do not need to be made one after another. Generally the Craft process can be paused at any time between Checks.
