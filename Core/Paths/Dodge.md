Dodging is an art and a science that takes practice, skill, and [[Point|Points!]]
# 1 Point
Whenever you are about to take [[Damage]], you may take an [[Action]] known as Dodge.

When you Dodge, you expend 4 [[Stamina]] to reduce the amount of Damage being taken by 1. Any remaining Damage reduces your [[Health]] as normal.

Taking the Dodge action outside of your [[Event#Turns|Turn]] requires a [[Action#Quick Actions|Quick Action]] as normal.

Taking the Dodge Action does not allow you to take a [[Action#Step|Step]].
>[!Example]
>A Character has 10/10 Stamina and 12/12 Health.
>The Character is about to take 11 Damage.
>They choose to Dodge and reduces their Stamina by 9.
>They take the rest of the Damage and now have 1/10 Stamina and 4/12 Health.
