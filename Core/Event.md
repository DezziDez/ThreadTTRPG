# Rounds
A 10-second period of time is a Round which contains a Turn for each Character in the Event.
Effects that trigger at the beginning of the Round always triggers before any Character's Turn in any order determined by The Weaver.
# Turns
Turns are localized moments of time for each Character. Each turn has three Phases.
## Phase 1: Start Turn
- Effects that trigger at the beginning of the Character's Turn trigger in any order of the Character's choice.
## Phase 2: Middle Turn
- The Character chooses to take any [Actions](./Action.md) or make [Checks](./Check.md).
## Phase 3: End Turn
- [Quick Actions](./Action.md#Quick%20Actions) cannot be used during this Phase.
- Effects that trigger at the end of the Character's Turn trigger in any order of The Weaver's choice.
- Choose the another Character in the Round to Start their Turn.
# Order
The Weaver determines the Character that initiated the Event. This Character Starts their turn after the beginning of the Round.

Characters choose which Character who has not had a Turn this Round goes next at the End of their Turns. 

Once all Characters in the Event have had a Turn. The last Character chooses any other Character to begin their Turn of the next Round.
# Hiding
Characters that are not known to others gain the [Hidden](../States/Hidden.md) [State](./State.md) towards those Characters that are not aware of them.
