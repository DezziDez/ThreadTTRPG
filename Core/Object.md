# */ ˈɒbʤɪkt /*
***Noun*** ~ Anything that is physical, visible, or tangible and is relatively stable in form
# What Is that?
Objects cover everything in a [Setting](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Setting) that the [Players](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Players) and [Characters](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters) can think about and interact with. Objects are explicitly not living Characters and cannot make choices on their own.
# Properties
Objects have properties that define how they function. These Properties generally synergies or modify each other. Some properties can be added to an Object multiple times to increase its effect.
# Object Health
All Objects have an amount of Health. An Object is considered to be Destroyed once its Health reaches 0.
An Object's Health is equal to twice its [Bulk](./Size.md#Bulk). Some Properties, such as the Primary [Material](./Craft.md#Materials) Property of the Object, might affect the Health of the Object.
