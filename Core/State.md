# How Did We Get Here?
States are effects or conditions that change how [[TTRPG#Characters|Characters]] function in various ways. All States provide a list of effects for the Character affected. If a Character gains a State, but it can't or doesn't affect them, they must gain the State regardless.
# Stacking
All States can have additional instances of the State on one Character at a time, called a Stack. States describe how the Stacks interact with the State, if at all.
# Removal
States can be Removed, the method for removing a state is described when the State is given. Doing so only Removes one Stack of the State unless stated otherwise.
# Multi States
States that are Multi describe different version of the same state. When described they will appear as "State Name {Multi Option}" such as Resistance {Physical} or Resistance(Multi) when there is no selection.

Effects that mention the Multi will appear as {Multi} which would then be substituted by the selected option.
