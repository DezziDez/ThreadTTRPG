# What Are The Odds?
Every TTRPG has some form of decision-making ability, which is usually performed with some kind of randomness generator. In Thread, this is done by giving each [[TTRPG#Players|Player]] and [[TTRPG#The Weaver|The Weaver]] a [standard 52-card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) with the addition of two different Jokers.
## Jokers
In each deck of cards, there will always be two jokers that represent extreme outcomes. The owner of each deck should assign the good (+🃏) and bad (-🃏) joker in their deck ahead of time.
Whenever a Joker is drawn, it <b><u>must</u></b> be used, unless otherwise noted.
# Card Values
The values of each card are as follows:

| Name  | Value | Name       | Symbol |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| Ace   | 1     | Clubs      | ♣      |
| 2     | 2     | Diamonds   | ♦      |
| 3     | 3     | Hearts     | ♥      |
| 4     | 4     | Spades     | ♠      |
| 5     | 5     | Good Joker | +🃏    |
| 6     | 6     | Bad Joker  | -🃏    |
| 7     | 7     |            |        |
| 8     | 8     |            |        |
| 9     | 9     |            |        |
| 10    | 10    |            |        |
| Jack  | 11    |            |        |
| Queen | 12    |            |        |
