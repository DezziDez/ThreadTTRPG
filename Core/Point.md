# What's The Point?
Points are a representation of power, development, and skill for all [Characters](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters). They are primarily spent on [Aspects](./Aspect.md) and [Paths](./Path.md). The value of Aspects and Paths generally do not exceed 10.
# Experience
Each Point is made up of 10 Experience. Characters gain Experience by moving the [Story](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Story) forward, participating in large [Events](./Event.md), from Training, showing up to the session, being especially creative, or anything that [The Weaver](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#The%20Weaver) sees as beneficial to the game and deserves rewarding.

Generally, at least 1 Experience should be awarded to each Character at the end of each session.
# Unspent Points
After a Full-Rest a Character may convert 10 Experience in to 1 Unspent Point. Unspent Points may then be spent on other parts of the Character.
# Spent Points
The number of Spent Points a Character has can be used to quickly determine how powerful a Character is. This can be used for balancing [Events](./Event.md) with other Characters or just as a quick representation of Character growth.
# Power Scales
A single Point is generally valued at 1/13th the maximum value it is representing. When creating Paths or other parts of Thread. It is advised to imagine 13 steps from beginning to end even if there are not 13 total steps.
