***Noun*** ~ An individual building unit to comprise a surface
# Watch Your Step
Tiles represent a single unit of measurement for determining distance, [[Size]], or movement. Tiles can be fractional such as 1/2 Tiles or 1/4 Tiles.
# Measure
A Tile for the purposes of scaling and other calculations is equal to 1 meter or 3 feet.
# Spaces
A Space is a unit of rough distance away from a target, such as a [[TTRPG#Characters|Character]]. The amount of Tiles each Space has as a maximum is equal to twice the number of Tiles in the previous Space.

1 Space = 2 Tiles | 2 Spaces = 5 Tiles | 3 Spaces = 10 tiles | 4 Spaces = 20 Tiles | . . .

Anything between two Spaces is considered to be within the higher of the two Spaces.

>[!Example]
>A Character that is 15 Tiles from another Character is considered to be 4 Spaces away.
## Within Error
Spaces are not exact and have variability given many circumstances. Each Space can be treated as having one Tile of addition per Space known as being Within Error.

This Error can be taken advantage of by Characters or [[TTRPG#The Weaver|The Weaver]] for the sake of the story. 

Some [[Path|Paths]] or [[Object|Objects]] may explicitly provide effects that function Within Error.
