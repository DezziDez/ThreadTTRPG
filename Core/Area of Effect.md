# Explosion!
An Area of Effect (AOE) is a projected area that some effect is taking place that affects all [[TTRPG#Characters|Characters]] and [[Object|Objects]] within that area.

AOE's have an Origin point unless stated otherwise. This point is where the AOE begins, spreading outwards from the Origin to its range.

## Radius
An AOE's Radius is defined as a number of [[Tile#Spaces|Spaces]] from the Origin.
## Line
An AOE as a Line is defined as having a distance of number of Spaces from the Origin with the addition of a number of [[Tile|Tiles]] as a width and a direction.
# Controlling
AOE's can either be Controlled or Uncontrolled. This determines that amount of control a Character has over what is affected by the AOE.
## Controlled
A Controlled AOE can be modified to affect only specific Characters or Objects within the Area.
## Uncontrolled
