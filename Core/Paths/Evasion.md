Whenever you are about to take [[Damage#Physical|Physical Damage]], you may take an [[Action]] known as Evade.

When you Evade, you expend 4 [[Stamina]] to reduce the amount of Physical Damage being taken by 1. Any remaining Physical Damage reduces your [[Health]] as normal.

Taking the Evade Action outside of your [[Event#Turns|Turn]] requires a [[Action#Quick Actions|Quick Action]] as normal.

Taking the Evade Action does not allow you to take a [[Action#Step|Step]].
