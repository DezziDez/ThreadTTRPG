# Order
The Weaver determines the Character that initiated the Event. This Character Starts their turn after the beginning of the Round.

Characters choose which Character who has not had a Turn this Round goes next at the End of their Turns. 

Once all Characters in the Event have had a Turn. The last Character chooses any other Character to begin their Turn of the next Round.
