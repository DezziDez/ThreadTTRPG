# Hang Time
If a Character were to Fall outside of their [[Event#Turns|Turn]] they do not being Falling until after completing the [[Event#Phase 1 Start Turn|Start]] of their Turn. 

During the [[Event#Phase 2 Middle Turn|Middle]] of their Turn, the Character has time for a single [[Action]] to attempt to prevent themselves from falling.

If the Character cannot prevent themselves from falling, they fall 100 Tiles and can continue with the rest of their Turn.
