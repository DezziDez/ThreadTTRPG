# Is There Fall Damage?
If a [Character](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters) Falls more than 1 [Tile](./Tile.md) then that Character would take [Unavoidable](./Damage.md#Unavoidable) [Physical Damage](./Damage.md#Physical) equal to twice the number of Tiles they fell.
# Hang Time
If a Character were to Fall outside of their [Turn](./Event.md#Turns) they do not being Falling until after completing the [Start](./Event.md#Phase%201%20Start%20Turn) of their Turn. 

During the [Middle](./Event.md#Phase%202%20Middle%20Turn) of their Turn, the Character has time for a single [Action](./Action.md) to attempt to prevent themselves from falling.

If the Character cannot prevent themselves from falling, they fall 100 Tiles and can continue with the rest of their Turn. 

If the Character is still falling after completing the [End](./Event.md#Phase%203%20End%20Turn) of their Turn, they fall an additional 400 Tiles.
