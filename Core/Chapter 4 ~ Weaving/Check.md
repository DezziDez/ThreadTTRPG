# Checking It Twice
Checks are made by adding the [[Point]] values of two [[Aspect|Aspects]] then [[Deck#Discard|Discarding]] and adding the [[Chance#Card Values|Value]] of a Card.

>[!Example]
>A Body+Mind Check
>The Character has 2 Points in the Body Aspect and 3 Points in the Mind Aspect.
>2 + 3 = 5
>A Jack of ‚ô¶ is then Discarded, which has a Value of 11.
>5 + 11 = 16
# The World
Checks can be made against the environment or [[TTRPG#Setting|World]]. [[TTRPG#The Weaver|The Weaver]] determines the Difficulty of the Check and can provide any amount of information about the Difficulty of the check as they wish.
## Difficulty
| Rating  | Value | Description                                                        |
| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trivial | 5-10  | Something that can be failed but it would be unfortunate to do so. |
| Easy    | 10-15 | Something that is a challenge but can usually be overcome.         |
| Normal  | 15-20 | A normal challenge. Can go either way.                             |
| Hard    | 20-25 | The peak of luck. Skill is definitely needed.                      |
| Extreme | 25+   | Something that not even luck can help you succeed.                 |
# Contests
Contests are Checks that occur between two or more Characters. The Checks do not need to be the same depending on the situation.
Characters may choose to have their Checks be public or private.

# Jokers
Whenever a [[Chance#Jokers|Joker]] is Discarded for a Check, it affects the Check as follows:

| +üÉè     | Draw an additional card, the value of that card is doubled. |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-**üÉè | **Draw no more cards, the Check fails.**                    |
# Choosing Failure
Characters can choose to fail any check. Choosing to fail must be done before Discarding. Doing so Discards no cards and expends no resources.
# Combinations
There are 10 combinations of Checks that can be made through the [[Aspect|Aspects]]:

| Combination   | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Body+Body     |             |
| Body+Mind     |             |
| Body+Spirit   |             |
| Body+Luck     |             |
| Mind+Mind     |             |
| Mind+Spirit   |             |
