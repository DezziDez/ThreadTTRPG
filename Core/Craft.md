**Verb** ~ To make or produce with care, skill, or ingenuity
# Whatcha Doin'?
To Craft is to create [[Object|Objects]] from Materials using time and skill. All [[TTRPG#Characters|Characters]] can Craft using [[Check|Checks]] and a bit of elbow grease.
# Materials
All Objects that are Crafted require Materials. These materials have their own [[Object#Properties|Properties]] that are added to the final Object.

To simulate the losses in the Crafting process, more Materials are needed than the finished Object will be made of. The amount of Materials needed is twice the final [[Size#Bulk|Bulk]] of the Object. Which is also one additional [[Size]] category.

>[!Example]
>A Character wishes to Craft a bow, which will have a Bulk of 2.
>The Character needs 4 Bulk worth of Materials to Craft the bow.
