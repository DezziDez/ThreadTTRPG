# What is Thread?
Thread is a table-top role playing system that is also a living document. And as such, is ever evolving and changing over time to better fit the needs of those that use it.

This system was built from the ground up to have modular, interweaving components that produce emergence from simplistic rules and structures.

Thread is designed without any settings in mind. Prioritizing story telling and pure creative freedom. Everything in Thread is optional and thus the world that the system is used in can behave in any way.
# Open Source
Thread's core rules were designed to be open source and free to use by anyone for any purpose. Thread is written in Markdown and all files to host a duplicate single page document are included in the Git repository.
# Navigation
This system and its pages can be viewed and navigated in multiple ways.
1. Thread is build to include links to other relevant pages. Using these links can allow someone to move through the document in any order they wish.
2. The document itself can be scrolled through continuously like any other documentation.
3. There is a search function implemented into the document that allows for quick and easy access to specific information.
