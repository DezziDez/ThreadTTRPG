# */ saɪz /*
***Noun*** ~ Physical magnitude, extent, or bulk; relative or proportionate dimensions
# What's Your Size?
All things, [[TTRPG#Characters|Characters]] and [[Object|Objects]], have a size that determines its relative dimensions.
Sizes can scale up and down infinitely and are rounded to their nearest number of [[Tile|Tiles]].
# Bulk
The Size of an Object or Character along with its relative weight determine its Bulk. Which represents the difficulty to move or carry the Object or Character.

The Bulk of a Character or Object generally doubles for each size increase beginning at 1 Bulk at Size Minute.
# Size and Bulk Chart

| Number of Tiles | Size   | Bulk  |
| --------------- | ------ | ----- |
| <0.25           | Minute | 1     |
| 0.5             | Tiny   | 2     |
| 1               | Small  | 4     |
| 2               | Medium | 8     |

# Visualization and Representation
Some games may use a visual representation of Characters and Objects on a map or area. These representations are usually referred to as Tokens. These Tokens have no restriction on their dimensions outside the size table.

>[!Example]
>A massive serpent that has 10 Tiles as their largest dimension. But the rest of their body is more cylindrical with 2 Tiles as their second-largest dimension. 
>So [[TTRPG#The Weaver|The Weaver]] may choose to represent the serpent in 5 medium-sized segments that move together.
>The serpent would still be a Size 10 Character, but their representation would be more accurate. Allowing for more dynamic [[Event|Events]].
