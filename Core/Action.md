# */ ˈæk ʃən /*
***Noun*** ~ An exertion of power, force, effect, or influence
# You Have The Power
Actions are used whenever a [[TTRPG#Characters|Character]] wants to do anything significant or energy consuming. 
# The Cost
Using an Action always causes the Character to [[Deck#Discard|Discard]] one Card and lose an amount of Stamina noted in the Action. 
An Action cannot cost less than one [[Stamina]] or Card unless **explicitly** noted otherwise.
# Continuous Cost
Some Actions may be Continuous. These actions have some constant use with the cost of an amount of Stamina at the [[Event#Turns#Phase 1 Start Turn|Start]] of the Character's Turn.

Continuous Actions can be ended at any time by the Character at no cost.
# Step
Unless noted otherwise, using an Action allows a Character to perform a Step and move 1 [[Tile]] in any direction they can access immediately before or immediately after the Action occurs.
# Quick Actions
Any Action can be performed as a Quick Action outside the Character's [[Event#Turns|Turn]]. Doing so requires twice The Cost of a regular use of the Action.
# Interruption
Actions cannot be taken on top of each other unless otherwise stated. If an Action is made when another Action has not been completed, the uncompleted Action is ended and the Cost of that Action is still spent.
# Free Action
A Free [[Action]] is any small and fast Action that still has some significance. All Characters have 1 Free Action they can use at any time during a [[Event#Rounds|Round]]. Additional Free Actions Cost 1 Stamina.

Free Actions do not allow a Character to take an extra Step like other Actions.
Free Actions do not Interrupt other Actions.
