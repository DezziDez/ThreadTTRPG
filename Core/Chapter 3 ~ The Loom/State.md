# How Did We Get Here?
States are effects or conditions that change [[TTRPGs#Characters|Characters]] in various ways. All states describe or have list of effects for the Character that has the State. If a Character gains a State, but it doesn't affect them, they must gain the State regardless.
# Stacking
Some States may have the ability to have Stacks. States that can be stacked will have extra rules for how the extra stacks interact with the State.
