Health is a resource that represents a [Character's](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters) Vitality and Luck.

A Character's Maximum Health value is calculated by adding the [Points](./Point.md) of the Character's [Body](./Aspect.md#♥%20Body) and [Luck](./Aspect.md#♣%20Luck) [Aspects](./Aspect.md).
>[!Example]
>If a Character has 3 Points in Body and 4 Points in Luck. Then the Character has a maximum Health of 7. (3+4 = 7)
# The Edge
Whenever a Character reaches 0 or less remaining Health. They gain the Over the Edge [State](./State.md).
## Death
Whenever a Character has an amount of negative Health greater than the Character's Maximum Health, that Character Dies.
# Healing
Some [Actions](./Action.md) or [Objects](./Object.md) allow Characters to regain Health.
A [Full-Rest](./Life.md#Full-Rest) allows a Character to regain an amount of Health equal to their Body Aspect.
A [Half-Rest](./Life.md#Half-Rest) allows a Character to regain 2 Health.
