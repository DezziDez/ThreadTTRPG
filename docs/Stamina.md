Stamina is a resource that represents a [[TTRPG#Characters|Character's]] Will and Endurance.

A Character's Maximum Stamina value is calculated by adding the [[Point|Points]] of the Character's [[Aspect#♦ Mind|Mind]] and [[Aspect#♠ Spirit|Spirit]] [[Aspect|Aspects]].
>[!Example]
>If a Character has 4 Points in Mind and 2 Points in Spirit. Then the Character has a maximum Stamina of 6. (4+2 = 6)
# Out of Steam
Whenever a Character has less than 0 Maximum Stamina, the Character gains 1 Stack of the [[Unconscious]] [[State]] for every negative Maximum Stamina the Character has.
