# How Did We Get Here?
States are effects or conditions that change how [[TTRPGs#Characters|Characters]] function in various ways. All states provide a list of effects for the Character affected. If a Character gains a State, but it doesn't affect them, they must gain the State regardless.
# Stacking
All States can have additional instances of the State on one Character at a time, called a Stack. States describe how the Stacks interact with the State, if at all.

If a State is to be removed, doing so only removes one Stack of the State, unless all Stacks are specified in the process.
# Multi States
States that are Multi describe different version of the same state. When described they will appear as "State Name(Multi Option)" such as Resistance(Physical) or Resistance(Multi) when there is no selection.

Effects that mention the Multi will appear as {Multi} which would then be substituted by the selected option.
