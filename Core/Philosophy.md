# */ fɪˈlɒs ə fi /*
***Noun*** ~ A system of principles for guidance or a particular system of thought
# Why?
The idea of [[Thread]] was born of frustration. A system was desired that gives all the tools necessary to create any world or concept without restrictions while being as simple as possible for anyone to understand. So, Thread was created. The intention is for Thread to be a working system, tool box, and toy box with everything needed inside all in one.
# Constraints
## Complexity Maximum
1. Calculations should never be anything other than addition or subtraction. Highest complexity being doubling which is X + X.
2. Calculations should never be more than 3 values. Generally 2.
3. The number of interactions in a rule set in the core rules should be at most 4. Generally 2-3.
4. The rules should be simple or condensed so any reader as young as 10 can understand and grasp the greater concepts.
5. Repetition for the sake of clarity is allowed.
6. Rules should not have edge cases or situations that add unnecessary complexity.
7. Rules should be explicit and written exactly how they are intended to function.
## Modularity
1. All rules should be broken down in to their base components within reason.
2. All core rules should have minimal dependence on each other within reason.
## Setting Agnostic
1. Avoid all biases, flavor text, standards, and tropes.
2. All rules should be written in a way to allow for any setting or campaign style with little to no modification.
3. The core rules must answer all questions within reason.
## Emergence
1. All rules should be able to interact with other parts of the system. No rules can exist in isolation.
2. All core rules should have an easily desired use case. No extreme niches.
3. Rule sets that create interesting interactions is encouraged. With respect to complexity. 
4. Avoid all loops or rule sets that do not end.
5. No immunities.
