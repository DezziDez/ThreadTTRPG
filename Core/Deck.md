***Noun*** ~ A complete set of 52 playing cards
# Nice Deck
All [Characters](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#Characters) and [The Weaver](../Introduction/TTRPG.md#The%20Weaver) are given a Deck of cards. This Deck represents a Character's long term [Luck](./Chance.md) and Energy. The Deck is used face down, so the next card on the top of the Deck is unknown.
# Discard
Discarding is the process of taking a card off the top of the Deck and placing it in to a new pile, the Discard, face up.
# Insert
Inserting is the process of shuffling the Discard, placing a random card from the Discard in to the Deck, then shuffling the Deck. The shuffling steps are only to ensure randomness and only have to be done once if multiple cards are inserted at once.
# The Weaver's Bottomless Deck
The Weaver is granted the ability to have a bottomless deck. Whenever a Character controlled by the Weaver causes a Discard, the Weaver may place the card on the bottom of their Deck instead. Shuffling when necessary.

This does not keep the Weaver from using individual Decks and Discards for certain Characters.
