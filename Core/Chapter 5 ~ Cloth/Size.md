# What's Your Size?
All things, [[TTRPG#Characters|Characters]] and [[Object|Objects]], have a size that determines its relative dimensions.
Sizes can scale up and down infinitely and are rounded to their nearest number of [[Tile|Tiles]].

| Number of Tiles | Size   |
| --------------- | ------ |
| <0.25           | Minute |
| 0.5             | Tiny   |
| 1               | Small  |
| 2               | Medium |
| 3               | Large  |
| 4               | Huge   |

# Visualization and Representation
Some games may use a visual representation of Characters and Objects on a map or area. These representations are usually referred to as Tokens. These Tokens have no restriction on their dimensions outside the size table.

>[!Example]
>A massive serpent that has 10 Tiles as their largest dimension. But the rest of their body is more cylindrical with 2 Tiles as their second-largest dimension. 
>So [[TTRPG#The Weaver|The Weaver]] may choose to represent the serpent in 5 medium-sized segments that move together.
>The serpent would still be a Size 10 Character, but their representation would be more accurate. Allowing for more dynamic [[Event|Events]].
